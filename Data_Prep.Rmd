#Data Preprocessing
```{r}
#Deleting Outliers
#Some observations have uniquely high value. These must be deleted to not effect the regression too much

#To allow for a flexible mean and sd, the measures are calculated by year. 
df_Leads <- df_Leads %>%
  mutate(Year = format(DateCreated, "%Y"))

summary_data <- df_Leads %>%
  group_by(Year = format(DateCreated, "%Y")) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_NextDayLeads = mean(NextDayLeads),

    Threshold = Mean_NextDayLeads + 4 * Sd_NextDayLeads  #Threshold is determined to begin 4 Sd over the Mean

df_Leads <- merge(df_Leads, summary_data, by = "Year") 

df_Leads <- df_Leads %>%
  filter(Threshold > NextDayLeads) %>%

### Feature Engeneering
```{r}
## Feature engineering. Idea: Add many features and select relevant ones later
# Add columns NextDayLeads for each Manual and Website with date 
data = df_Leads %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Type, values_from = NextDayLeads) %>%
  rename(Date = DateCreated, 
         NextDayLeads.Manual = Manual,
         NextDayLeads.Website = Website)

# Add 7 and 30 day rolling Average for NextDayLeads for each Manual and Website Leads.
data = data %>%
  mutate(NextDayLeads.Manual.7RA = rollapplyr(NextDayLeads.Manual, 7, mean, partial = TRUE, na.rm = T), # 7 day RA for Manual Leads
         NextDayLeads.Manual.30RA = rollapplyr(NextDayLeads.Manual, 30, mean, partial = TRUE, na.rm = T), # 30 day RA for Manual Leads
         NextDayLeads.Website.7RA = rollapplyr(NextDayLeads.Website, 7, mean, partial = TRUE, na.rm = T), # 7 day RA for Website
         NextDayLeads.Website.30RA = rollapplyr(NextDayLeads.Website, 30, mean, partial = TRUE, na.rm = T)) # 30 day RA for Website Leads

# Merge Advertisement data (clicks, impressions and money spend) and also compute 7day RA of those values
# group ad data by day and sum up clicks, impressions and money spend per day
df_Ads <- df_Ads %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(AdImpressions = sum(Impressions),
            AdClicks= sum(Clicks),
            AdSpend= sum(Spend))

# Merging Ad data to our data set
data = merge(data, df_Ads, by="Date", all.x = TRUE)
# 7 day RA of impressions, clicks and money spend
data = cbind(data, AdImpressions.7RA = rollapplyr(data$AdImpressions, 7, mean, partial = TRUE)) 
data = cbind(data, AdClicks.7RA = rollapplyr(data$AdClicks, 7, mean, partial = TRUE)) 
data = cbind(data, AdSpend.7RA = rollapplyr(data$AdSpend, 7, mean, partial = TRUE)) 

# Merging Website Traffic data to our dataframe
data = merge(data, df_Traffic, by="Date", all.x = TRUE)
# 7 day RA of visits and time spent
data = cbind(data, Visits.7RA = rollapplyr(data$Visits, 7, mean, partial = TRUE)) 
data = cbind(data, TimeSpent.7RA = rollapplyr(data$TimeSpent, 7, mean, partial = TRUE)) 

# merge macro data
# First compute differences of DAX values
df_Macro = cbind(df_Macro[-1,], DAX_diff = diff(df_Macro$DAX))
#merge
data = merge(data, df_Macro, by="Date", all.x = TRUE)
```

#Feature Engineering based on Date
```{r}
# Add Boolean feature IsNextDayWorkDay, which indicates if the NEXT day is a workday (not a weekend or a holiday). Needs Package timeDate. Also add Month Factor Feature

# Get official German Holidays (only country wide)
holidaysDE = holiday(year= c(2020,2021,2022,2023), Holiday = listHolidays("DE"))
# add column indicating if the next day is a work day and month variable
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(isNextDayWorkDay = if_else(isBizday(as.timeDate(as.Date(Date)+1),holidays = holidaysDE, wday = 1:5), 1, 0),
         month = factor(month(Date), labels = month.name))

```

#Data Wrangling
```{r}
#Fill the Macro-Economic Data with the previous values in case of empty values (weekends)
data <- data %>%
  fill(DAX,
       `Bundesanleihen 10 Year`,
       `Gold (in Euro)`,
       `German Electricity Price`,
       `Oilprice (Brent)`,
       `Federal Funds Futures (Expectations in 12 Months)`,
       `Job Postings in Germany on Indeed`, 
       `US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index`,
       `Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI)`,
       `Yield Spread 10Y - 2Y (Germany)`, 
       `Yield Spread 10Y - 2Y (US)`,
       `Exchange Rate (1 USD = X EUR)`, 
       `US Corporate Bonds - Investment Grade - Option Adjusted Spread`,
       DAX_diff,
       .direction = "down")
```

### Feature Selection
```{r}
subset_data = data %>% 
  select(c(2,3,8,9,10,14,15,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,31,32)) %>%
  rename(Bundesanleihen = `Bundesanleihen 10 Year`,
         Oilprice = `Oilprice (Brent)`,
         FFF = `Federal Funds Futures (Expectations in 12 Months)`,
         `Job Postings` = `Job Postings in Germany on Indeed`,
         USEPUI = `US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index`,
         BDI = `Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI)`,
         `Yield Spread GER` = `Yield Spread 10Y - 2Y (Germany)`)
M = cor(subset_data,use = "complete.obs")
corrplot(M, method = 'color', order = 'alphabet',mar=c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1), type = "upper",tl.cex=0.5)

## We use the Recursive Feature Elimination method (RFE) to find the optimal subset of features for Manual Lead data and Website Lead data separately.
data = na.omit(data)
filterCtrl <- rfeControl(functions=rfFuncs, method="cv",number = 3)
resultsManual <- rfe(x= data[,c(-1,-2,-3)],y= data[,2], sizes=c(1:29), rfeControl=filterCtrl, na.action = na.omit)
resultsWebsite <- rfe(x= data[,c(-1,-2,-3)],y= data[,3], sizes=c(1:29), rfeControl=filterCtrl,na.action = na.omit)
plot(resultsManual)
plot(resultsWebsite)

print(resultsManual)
print(resultsWebsite)

acf(data$NextDayLeads.Manual)
